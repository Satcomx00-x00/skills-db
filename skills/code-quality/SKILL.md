description: Apply programming principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, LoD, CQS), refactoring techniques, and design patterns to write clean, maintainable, extensible code. Use this skill whenever someone asks to refactor code, review code quality, clean up messy code, reduce duplication, improve architecture, fix code smells, apply design patterns, or says things like "this code is ugly", "this is getting hard to maintain", "how do I structure this better", or "can you clean this up" — even if they don't use the words "code quality".

# code-quality

Code quality mastery — programming principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI…), refactoring techniques, and design patterns to write clean, maintainable, extensible software.

## Workflow

When asked to improve or review code quality:

1. **Identify smells** — scan the code for the symptoms in the table below
2. **Diagnose** — determine which principle is being violated
3. **Select a technique** — pick the most impactful refactoring or pattern (start with the highest-value, lowest-risk change)
4. **Apply incrementally** — make one change at a time; preserve observable behaviour at each step
5. **Explain the why** — tell the user what you changed and why, so they learn the principle, not just the fix

### Code Smell → Diagnosis → Technique

| Symptom | Violated Principle | Technique |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Method > 30 lines | SRP / too much responsibility | [`extract-method`](extract-method/SKILL.md), [`guard-clauses`](guard-clauses/SKILL.md) |
| Class > 300 lines | SRP violation | [`extract-class`](extract-class/SKILL.md), [`move-method`](move-method/SKILL.md) |
| Deep `if/else` nesting | Complexity / SRP | [`guard-clauses`](guard-clauses/SKILL.md), [`decompose-conditional`](decompose-conditional/SKILL.md) |
| Switch / if-chain on a type field | OCP / LSP violation | [`replace-conditional-polymorphism`](replace-conditional-polymorphism/SKILL.md) |
| Parameter list > 4 items | Low cohesion | [`introduce-parameter-object`](introduce-parameter-object/SKILL.md) |
| Duplicated code blocks | DRY violation | [`extract-method`](extract-method/SKILL.md) |

| Unexplained literal (`86400`, `'ADMIN'`) | Readability | [`replace-magic-number`](replace-magic-number/SKILL.md) |
| Deep chain `a.b.c.d` | Law of Demeter | [`move-method`](move-method/SKILL.md) |
| Method returns a value AND mutates state | CQS violation | [`separate-query-from-modifier`](separate-query-from-modifier/SKILL.md) |
| Temp variable caches a simple calculation | Clarity | [`replace-temp-with-query`](replace-temp-with-query/SKILL.md) |
| Trivial one-liner method | YAGNI / over-indirection | [`inline-method`](inline-method/SKILL.md) |
| Creation logic scattered or conditional | Creational complexity | [`factory-method`](factory-method/SKILL.md), [`builder`](builder/SKILL.md) |
| Runtime behaviour switching on type | Open/Closed | [`strategy`](strategy/SKILL.md), [`state`](state/SKILL.md) |
| Tightly coupled cross-object communication | Coupling | [`mediator`](mediator/SKILL.md), [`observer`](observer/SKILL.md) |

> **Language note**: All principles and techniques apply regardless of language. Examples below use TypeScript, but the same patterns work in Python, Java, Go, C#, and others — adjust syntax accordingly.

## Instructions

Apply code quality practices to continuously improve codebases:

### Programming Principles

Core principles every codebase should follow regardless of language or paradigm.

#### SOLID

Five OOP principles that make systems easy to extend and maintain:

| Principle | Full name | Rule |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility | A class/module has one reason to change |
| **O** | Open/Closed | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution | Subtypes must be substitutable for their base type |
| **I** | Interface Segregation | Prefer many small interfaces over one fat interface |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions, not concretions |

**S — Single Responsibility**
```ts
// ❌ one class handles both data and formatting
class Report { generate() {} formatAsPdf() {} sendByEmail() {} }

// ✅ each class has one job
class Report      { generate(): ReportData {} }
class PdfRenderer { render(data: ReportData): Buffer {} }
class Mailer      { send(to: string, body: Buffer) {} }
```

**O — Open/Closed**
```ts
// ❌ must edit existing class to add discount type
class Discount { calc(type: string, price: number) {
  if (type === 'vip') return price * 0.8;
  if (type === 'seasonal') return price * 0.9;
}}

// ✅ add new behaviour by adding a new class
interface Discount { apply(price: number): number; }
class VipDiscount      implements Discount { apply(p) { return p * 0.8; } }
class SeasonalDiscount implements Discount { apply(p) { return p * 0.9; } }
```

**L — Liskov Substitution**
```ts
// ❌ Square overrides setWidth in a way that violates Rectangle's contract
class Rectangle { setWidth(w: number) {} setHeight(h: number) {} area() {} }
class Square extends Rectangle { setWidth(w: number) { super.setWidth(w); super.setHeight(w); } }

// ✅ use a shared Shape interface instead of inheritance
interface Shape { area(): number; }
class Rectangle implements Shape { area() { return this.w * this.h; } }
class Square    implements Shape { area() { return this.side ** 2; } }
```

**I — Interface Segregation**
```ts
// ❌ Printer forced to implement fax it doesn't support
interface Machine { print(): void; scan(): void; fax(): void; }

// ✅ split into focused interfaces
interface Printer { print(): void; }
interface Scanner { scan(): void; }
interface Fax     { fax(): void; }
class SimplePrinter implements Printer { print() {} }
```

**D — Dependency Inversion**
```ts
// ❌ high-level module depends on low-level concrete class
class OrderService { private db = new MySqlDatabase(); }

// ✅ depend on an abstraction; inject the implementation
interface Database { save(data: object): void; }
class OrderService { constructor(private db: Database) {} }
```

#### DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

> "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." — The Pragmatic Programmer

- **Duplication of logic** → extract into a shared function, class, or module
- **Duplication of data** → derive it from a single source of truth; don't copy-paste constants
- **Duplication of structure** → use generics, templates, or higher-order functions
- **What DRY is NOT**: don't blindly deduplicate code that looks the same but represents different concepts — premature abstraction is worse than duplication

```ts
// ❌ same validation logic copy-pasted in three places
function createUser(email: string) { if (!email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid'); }
function updateUser(email: string) { if (!email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid'); }

// ✅ single source of truth
function assertValidEmail(email: string) { if (!email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email'); }
function createUser(email: string) { assertValidEmail(email); }
function updateUser(email: string) { assertValidEmail(email); }
```

---

#### KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci

- Write the simplest solution that solves the problem
- Avoid clever tricks, unnecessary abstractions, and premature generalisation
- Code is read far more often than it is written — optimise for the reader
- If you need a comment to explain *what* code does, the code is probably too complex

```ts
// ❌ over-engineered
const isAdult = (age: number) => !!(age >= 18 ? true : false) === true;

// ✅ simple and clear
const isAdult = (age: number) => age >= 18;
```

---

#### YAGNI — You Aren't Gonna Need It

> "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them." — Ron Jeffries (XP)

- Don't add functionality, abstractions, or configuration hooks "just in case"
- Every line of speculative code must be maintained, tested, and understood
- Prefer to refactor when the need arises; don't design for imaginary requirements
- Works in tandem with KISS — both fight accidental complexity

---

#### Law of Demeter (LoD) — Principle of Least Knowledge

> "Only talk to your immediate friends."

A method should only call methods on:
1. Its own object (`this`)
2. Objects passed as parameters
3. Objects it creates itself
4. Its direct component objects

```ts
// ❌ "train wreck" — violates LoD
const city = customer.getAddress().getCity().getName();

// ✅ ask the object, don't dig into it
const city = customer.getCityName();
```

---

#### CQS — Command-Query Separation

Every method should be **either**:
- A **Query**: returns a value, has no side effects (safe to call multiple times)
- A **Command**: performs an action/mutation, returns `void`

Never both. (See also the [`separate-query-from-modifier`](separate-query-from-modifier/SKILL.md) refactoring.)

---

#### SoC — Separation of Concerns

Different concerns (UI, business logic, persistence, networking) must live in separate modules with clear boundaries. Changes to one concern should not ripple into others.

- **MVC / layered architecture**: Controller ↔ Service ↔ Repository
- **CSS/HTML/JS separation** in frontend
- **Domain logic must not import HTTP or DB packages**

---

#### Fail Fast

Detect and surface errors as early and loudly as possible:
- Validate inputs at the entry point (constructor, API boundary)
- Throw/return errors immediately when a precondition is violated
- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Prefer explicit `null` / `undefined` checks over optional chaining that hides bugs

```ts
// ❌ silent failure — caller has no idea something went wrong
function parseAge(s: string): number { return parseInt(s) || 0; }

// ✅ fail fast — caller is informed of the problem
function parseAge(s: string): number {
  const n = parseInt(s, 10);
  if (isNaN(n)) throw new TypeError(`Invalid age: "${s}"`);
  return n;
}
```

---

#### Composition over Inheritance

Favour assembling behaviour from small, focused objects (composition) over deep inheritance hierarchies.

- Inheritance creates tight coupling between parent and child classes
- Composition allows behaviour to be mixed in, swapped, or reused across unrelated classes
- Use inheritance only when a genuine **is-a** relationship exists; use composition for **has-a**

```ts
// ❌ fragile inheritance hierarchy
class Animal { breathe() {} }
class FlyingAnimal extends Animal { fly() {} }
class SwimmingAnimal extends Animal { swim() {} }
// What about a duck? It both flies and swims — multiple inheritance problem.

// ✅ compose capabilities
const canFly   = { fly:  () => console.log('flying') };
const canSwim  = { swim: () => console.log('swimming') };
const duck = Object.assign({ name: 'Duck' }, canFly, canSwim);
duck.fly(); duck.swim();
```

## Guidelines

The following rules are **mandatory** regardless of language or project type:

### Type Safety

- **Full type annotations**: annotate all function parameters, return types, and variables — no implicit `any` in TypeScript, no unannotated functions in Python
- **No `any` types**: use `unknown` and narrow down, or define precise types; `@ts-ignore` is forbidden except in generated/vendor code
- **Runtime validation at boundaries**: validate data from external sources (HTTP requests, file reads, env vars, user input) with Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic / dataclasses (Python) — never trust raw input
- **Strict null checks**: never access a property on a possibly-null value without an explicit guard

### Error Handling

- **Never silently swallow exceptions** — always handle or re-throw with added context
- **Typed error classes**: define domain-specific error types (`UserNotFoundError`, `ValidationError`) instead of bare `Error('message')`
- **Log at the catch boundary** — use structured logging (`loguru` in Python / `console.error` with context in TypeScript) including relevant IDs (userId, requestId)
- **Propagate meaningful messages**: error messages must tell the caller *what* went wrong, *where*, and ideally *why*

### Immutability

- Prefer `const` over `let`; prefer `readonly` properties and `Readonly<T>` in TypeScript
- Never mutate function parameters — clone if modification is needed
- Prefer pure functions: same input always produces same output, no hidden side effects

### Naming Conventions

- Names must express intent: `getUserByEmail()` not `getUser()` or `fetch()`
- Booleans read as yes/no questions: `isAuthenticated`, `hasPermission`, `canRetry`
- Constants in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for global/module-level values
- No single-letter variables except loop indices (`i`, `j`) and well-known math/science notation

### Code Size Limits

| Unit | Limit |
|------|-------|
| Function/method | ≤ 30 lines |
| File/module | ≤ 300 lines |
| Cyclomatic complexity | ≤ 10 per function |
| Parameters per function | ≤ 4 (use a parameter object beyond this) |

### Documentation

- Public functions and classes **must** have doc-comments (`TSDoc` / Python docstring)
- Complex business logic requires an inline comment explaining *why*, not *what*
- No commented-out code in committed files — use version control instead
- READMEs must be updated alongside the code they describe

### Refactoring Techniques

Improve internal structure without changing external behaviour:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`extract-method`](extract-method/SKILL.md) | Pull fragment into a named method |
| [`inline-method`](inline-method/SKILL.md) | Replace trivial delegation with direct body |
| [`extract-variable`](extract-variable/SKILL.md) | Name a complex expression |
| [`replace-temp-with-query`](replace-temp-with-query/SKILL.md) | Replace temp variable with method call |
| [`replace-magic-number`](replace-magic-number/SKILL.md) | Replace literal with named constant |
| [`decompose-conditional`](decompose-conditional/SKILL.md) | Extract condition/branches into methods |
| [`guard-clauses`](guard-clauses/SKILL.md) | Eliminate nesting with early returns |
| [`replace-conditional-polymorphism`](replace-conditional-polymorphism/SKILL.md) | Replace type-switches with polymorphism |
| [`extract-class`](extract-class/SKILL.md) | Split a class with too many responsibilities |
| [`move-method`](move-method/SKILL.md) | Move method to the class that uses it most |
| [`introduce-parameter-object`](introduce-parameter-object/SKILL.md) | Replace parameter group with object |
| [`separate-query-from-modifier`](separate-query-from-modifier/SKILL.md) | Split read/write methods |

### Design Patterns

**Creational** — object creation mechanisms:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`singleton`](singleton/SKILL.md) | One shared instance |
| [`factory-method`](factory-method/SKILL.md) | Subclass decides which class to instantiate |
| [`abstract-factory`](abstract-factory/SKILL.md) | Families of related objects |
| [`builder`](builder/SKILL.md) | Step-by-step complex object construction |
| [`prototype`](prototype/SKILL.md) | Clone existing objects |

**Structural** — compose objects into larger structures:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`adapter`](adapter/SKILL.md) | Convert incompatible interfaces |
| [`bridge`](bridge/SKILL.md) | Decouple abstraction from implementation |
| [`composite`](composite/SKILL.md) | Tree of uniform single/container objects |
| [`decorator`](decorator/SKILL.md) | Wrap to add behaviour dynamically |
| [`facade`](facade/SKILL.md) | Simple interface to a complex subsystem |
| [`flyweight`](flyweight/SKILL.md) | Share state among many fine-grained objects |
| [`proxy`](proxy/SKILL.md) | Controlled access to another object |

**Behavioral** — communication between objects:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`chain-of-responsibility`](chain-of-responsibility/SKILL.md) | Pass request along a handler chain |
| [`command`](command/SKILL.md) | Encapsulate request as an object |
| [`iterator`](iterator/SKILL.md) | Traverse collection without exposing structure |
| [`mediator`](mediator/SKILL.md) | Centralise cross-object communication |
| [`memento`](memento/SKILL.md) | Save and restore object state |
| [`observer`](observer/SKILL.md) | Notify dependents of state changes |
| [`state`](state/SKILL.md) | Alter behaviour when internal state changes |
| [`strategy`](strategy/SKILL.md) | Swap interchangeable algorithms at runtime |
| [`template-method`](template-method/SKILL.md) | Define algorithm skeleton; subclasses fill steps |
| [`visitor`](visitor/SKILL.md) | Separate algorithm from object structure |

### Principles

- **Refactor before adding features** — clean code is easier to extend
- **Small, safe steps** — run tests after each refactoring
- **Apply patterns to solve problems, not to show off** — prefer simplicity; use patterns when they reduce coupling or duplication
- **Boy Scout Rule** — leave code cleaner than you found it
- **Principle of Least Surprise** — code should behave as a reasonable reader would expect
